# Fun with Elevator üõó

A 3D interactive elevator puzzle game built with React Three.js, featuring physics-based gameplay with elevators, platforms, and challenging navigation mechanics.

## üéÆ Project Overview

This project is a 3D browser-based game where players navigate through multiple floors using elevators and avoiding fall-through holes. The game demonstrates advanced React Three.js concepts, physics simulation, and interactive 3D gameplay mechanics.

### Key Features

- **3D Physics Simulation**: Real-time physics using Rapier physics engine
- **Multi-floor Navigation**: Dynamic elevator system connecting multiple floors
- **Interactive Gameplay**: WASD movement controls with collision detection
- **Procedural Level Design**: Randomized hole placement for replayability
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Player Controls

- **WASD Keys**: Move the player character around the 3D environment
- **Physics**: Player falls through holes and can ride elevators between floors

### Level Design

- **4 Floors**: Multi-level vertical gameplay with increasing complexity
- **Elevator System**: Moving platforms that transport players between floors
- **Dynamic Holes**: Procedurally placed fall-through holes create navigation challenges
- **Grid-based Layout**: 3x3 tile system for precise movement and positioning

### Elevator Mechanics

- Elevators automatically move between floors at a consistent speed
- Each floor (except the top) has one elevator going upward
- Elevator positions are predefined but cycle through different locations
- Players must time their movement to catch elevators

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Physics Engine**: React Three Rapier for realistic physics simulation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
